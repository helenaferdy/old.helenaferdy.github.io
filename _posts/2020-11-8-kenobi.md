This time we're gonna try to hack a machine called "Kenobi" from tryhackme. It's a linux machine so it's gonna be fun seeing the different hacking methodology on windows and linux.
Let's just get into it.

As usual, we fire up our nmap scan to get some information about the machine.

We got a lot of information here. We can see that this machine is running quite a few services, starting with FTP on port 21, SSH on port 22, Web on port 80, some rpc services for nfs on port 111, and SMB on port 139/445.

Let's start enumerating the web service on port 80. We can do that by accessing the ip of the machine on our browser.

&nbsp;  

Nothing's here. Our nmap scan says that this web has an "admin.html" file that we can access.
Let's just do that.

It's a dead end.
Let's move on and try to enumerate other services.

This time we're gonna try to access the SMB service, we can try to list	all the available shares with "-L" command.

We can see that it has an anonymous share that we can access.

&nbsp;  

This share has nothing but a log.txt, let's just grab that and get the hell out.

Okay, this log contains some interesting information, where it says that the user (kenobi) has a private ssh key laying around in his home directory. It's a good information but not really useful at the moment because we still don't have any access to that directory.

Let's end our smb enumeration there and move on to enumerate nfs service on port 111.

We can run this nmap script to list out all the available share on nfs service.

&nbsp;  

Okay, now we know that directory "/var" is available for us to mount. 
With this in mind, we can probably now use ProFTPd to try to copy user kenobi's private ssh key to this mount so we can grab it to our machine.

Let's get into the ftp share using netcat.

&nbsp;  


Here we perform "SITE CPFR" and "SITE CPTO" which stands for "Copy From" and "Copy To" respectively.
We're essentially just copying kenobi's ssh private key from his home directory to the /var directory where we can mount it to our machine and grab the key.

So let's mount the share and copy the key.

&nbsp;  

Okay now we have a hold of the key.

&nbsp;  


Let's give it an appropriate permission with "chmod" and connect to the machine using ssh.

Awesome. We have successfully compromised this machine.
But we're still just a regular kenobi user, let's find a way to elevate our privilege.


We can try to find a binary with SUID permission.
SUID permission basically lets us to run a file as root, with only using a regular user account. It's pretty neat and dangerous.

&nbsp;  

Listing all the suid files, we can see one file is out of ordinary.
Let's try running it to get better idea of what it's doing.

&nbsp;  

So it's a custom binary to run some basic bash command.
As you can see, when i put an input of "3", it shows the result of "ifconfig" command.

With this, we can try to redirect the binary to execute our custom command instead of the real one.

We can do this by creating our own "ifconfig" file, but some some twist, where this ifconfig actually invokes another command, which is "/bin/bash". 

So when the "ifconfig" command gets triggered, it will invoke a new bash shell with the permission of root.

&nbsp;  

We also need to export a custom $PATH so our ifconfig gets invoked first before the real one.


Let's try running it one more time.

&nbsp;  


And viola. We get the root privilege access on this machine.
We can basically do whatever we want now. Pretty cool!
