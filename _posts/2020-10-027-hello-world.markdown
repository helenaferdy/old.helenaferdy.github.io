First of all, Thank you for stopping by.

# Who am I?
Hi, I am `Kadek Sena Perdiana`, a fresh graduate, a tech enthusiast, a big Green Day fan, a mediocre coder, a CCNA certified, network engineer wannabe, and a future pentester.

I was born in Bali, Indonesia, in 1997. I've lived here for as long as i can remember. I love being here, but outside world is kinda intriguing as well. maybe one day.

Right now i work in the IT-helpdesk field, the kinda job you have to step on in order to gain enough experience so you can pass the HR filter. I love doing what i do now, but i also can't wait to leave this behind and start doing what i've always wanted to do. hacking!


#### I believe in the statement -
> "Indifference and complacency hold the progress of humanity"

I completely made that up, it may sounds like a total nonsense, but at least it sounds pretty cool!


# What is this site about?
I like to solve some hacking/ctf stuff in my spare time, and i figured maybe i wanted to make some kind of platform as a diary so i can somewhat share what i do and what i'm passionate about to the outside world. I'm not an expert by any means, and this is not meant to be a tutorial. It's just me wasting my time doing something somewhat kinda interesting.
Because, hey, it's not a waste of time if you enjoy the time you that you waste.
