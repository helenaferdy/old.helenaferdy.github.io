For this attack, we're gonna try to infiltrate and gain shell access to a machine called "Ice" on tryhackme. It is also a free machine so you can spin it up and give it a go.

As usual, we start every attack with ports enumeration with Nmap.

&nbsp;  

The nmap scan shows that it has 3 ports open, 139 and 445 which are for smb stuff, and port 8000 which looks kinda interesting.
It says that the port is for a service called Icecast, which is a streaming media server.

Doing a little bit of searching using searchsploit, we found some interesting exploits that we can utilize.

We're gonna try the one written in ruby and available on Metasploit.

Let's fire up metasploit and search for Icecast.

&nbsp;  

Metasploit found one exploit for icecast, the same one that we found on searchsploit.
Let's use it.

As usual, fill in all the necessary values for the module to work. And here i use "tun0" as my local address, which is the name of the interface that i use.

Running the exploit gave us an easy win to the machine. We even have a meterpreter shell instead of a generic shell. Everything seems perfect, right?

&nbsp;  

Not really, as you can see, we're only a regular user, so we need to do some privilege escalation to elevate our access to the machine.

Let's use a post exploitation module called "suggester". It is a multi recon exploit that can give us some exploit suggestion that we can run on this machine.

&nbsp;  

The suggester found quite a few exploits that we can try. At this point we can try those exploits one by one until we get a hit.

So let's just do that.

&nbsp;  

This is the first one on the list, lets run it.

The modules says "bypassuac", which stands for "Bypass User Access Control". This might be exactly what we need.

&nbsp;  

Looks like the exploit worked and a new meterpreter session has been invoked.
But we're still just a regular user.

&nbsp;  


Because we already bypassed the UAC, we can attempt to run "getsystem" to get system level privilege and escalate our access to this machine.

&nbsp;  


And it was a success. Now we have the highest privilege on the machine.

But one more thing, if we type "sysinfo", we can see that we have a little bit of a problem.

&nbsp;  


Our meterpreter shell doesn't match with the OS architecture, so we're gonna do a classic process migration to overcome this.

Let's run "ps" to see all running process.

&nbsp;  

We're gonna pick a process that's run by SYSTEM and with x64 architecture.
I'm picking winlogon.exe here.

&nbsp;  

And our migration process succeeded. We have a matching architecture with system privilege.

Now for the cherry on top, we can dump users credentials and attemp to crack the passwords.

And we got the password. Easy win!
