# Who am I?
Hi, I am `Kadek Sena Perdiana`, a fresh graduate, a tech enthusiast, a big Green Day fan, a mediocre coder, a CCNA certified, a Network Engineer wannabe, and a future Pentester.
&nbsp; 

I was born in Bali, Indonesia, 22 years ago. I've lived here for as long as i can remember. I love being here, but outside world is kinda intriguing as well. maybe one day.
&nbsp; 

Right now i work in the IT-helpdesk field, the kinda job you have to step on in order to gain enough experience to pass the HR filter. I love doing what i do now, but i also can't wait to leave this all behind and start doing what i've always wanted to do, hacking!

&nbsp; 

#### I believe in the statement -
> "Indifference and complacency hold the progress of humanity"

I completely made that up, it may sounds like a total nonsense, and it is, but at least it sounds pretty cool!

&nbsp; 

# What is this site about?
I like to solve some hacking/ctf stuff in my spare time, and i figured maybe i wanted to make some kind of platform to share what i do and what i'm passionate about. I'm not an expert by any means, and this is not meant to be a tutorial. It's just me wasting my time doing something kinda interesting.
Because, hey, it's not a waste of time if you enjoy the time you waste.
